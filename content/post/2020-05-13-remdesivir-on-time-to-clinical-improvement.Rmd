Now consider [the previous example of Remdesivir](http://127.0.0.1:5274/2020/05/12/remdesivir/) but instead we are interested in the continuous outcome variable of time to clinical improvement.

We can interpret the robustness of inference regarding Remdesivir's effect on time to clinical improvement in following ways. 

## Percent bias necessary to invalidate the inference

To invalidate an inference, $70.544\%$ of the estimate would have to be due to bias. This is based on a threshold of $0.362$ for statistical significance ($\alpha = 0.05$). To invalidate an inference, $186$ of the observations would have to be replaced with cases for which the effect is $0$.

## Impact threshold for a confounding variable

The minimum impact to invalidate an inference for a null hypothesis of $0$ effect is based on a correlation of $0.546$ with the outcome and at $0.546$ with the predictor of interest (conditioning on observed covariates) based on a threshold of $0.121$ for statistical significance ($\alpha = 0.05$). Correspondingly the impact of an omitted variable (as defined in Frank 2000) must be $0.546 \times 0.546 = 0.298$ to invalidate an inference for a null hypothesis of $0$ effect.

## Using KonFound-it to reproduce the results

Since the outcome is a continuous variable, we use pkonfound.
```{r}
konfound::pkonfound(est_eff = 1.23, 
          std_err = .184, 
          n_obs = 263, 
          n_covariates = 0)
```
