<p>Consider <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31022-9/fulltext">the recent randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19</a>. The study found no discernable difference in mortality: Twenty-two of <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(14\%\)</span>) Remdesivir patients died within <span class="math inline">\(28\)</span> days while <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(78\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(13\%\)</span>) in the placebo group died (Table 1). How different would the results have to be in the current study to change statistical inference about Remdesivir?</p>

<p>To answer this question, we identify the number of Remdesivir treatment patients that would need to be switched between “died” and “survived” to exceed an effect size of a given magnitude – a quantity we refer to as the Robustness of the Inference to Switches (RIS). We calculate that the effect would be statistically significant and positive if <span class="math inline">\(14\)</span> or more of the <span class="math inline">\(22\)</span> treated patients who died instead had survived (<span class="math inline">\(RIS=-14\)</span>).
Figure 1 places these results in a larger context by plotting the change in effect size as a function of switching outcomes for treatment cases. The estimated effect from the observed data is <span class="math inline">\(14\)</span> switches below the top dashed line representing statistical significance at the <span class="math inline">\(.05\)</span> level for a positive finding, and <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> switches above statistical significance at the <span class="math inline">\(.05\)</span> level for a negative finding (bottom dashed line). The RIS shows that even though the estimated effect is near zero, a change in outcomes for a small absolute number of patients (<span class="math inline">\(14\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span>) could generate a different inference in either direction.</p>

<h2>Using KonFound-it! to reproduce the results</h2>
<p>Now let’s see how to use R package konfound to reproduce the results.</p>
<p>Similar to the HCQ example, we have a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times2\)</span> table in this Remdesivir example. Accordingly, we use tkonfound function to calculates the number of cases (RIS) that would have to be switched from one cell to another of a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times2\)</span> table to invalidate an inference made about the association between the rows and columns.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>konfound::tkonfound(a = 10, b = 68, c = 22, d= 136)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;The tkonfound function calculates the number of cases that would have to be switched from one cell to another of a 2x2 table to invalidate an inference made about the association between the rows and columns. This can be applied to treatment vs control with successful vs unsuccessful outcomes.&quot;

## [[2]]
## [1] &quot;See konfound_fig for full and accessible details in graphic form!&quot;
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] &quot;To sustain an inference, 16 cases need to be transferred from treatment success to treatment failure, as shown, from the User-entered Table to the Transfer Table.&quot;
## 
## $User_enter_value
##           Fail Success
## Control     10      68
## Treatment   22     136

## $Transfer_Table
##           Fail Success
## Control     10      68
## Treatment   38     120

## [1] &quot;For the User-entered Table, we have a Pearson&#39;s chi square of 0.054, with p value of 0.816.&quot;

## [[7]]
## [1] &quot;For the Transfer Table, we have a Pearson&#39;s chi square of 4.065, with p value of 0.044.&quot;</code></pre>
