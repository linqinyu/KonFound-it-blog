Welcome to our discussion about sensitivity analysis. All of the assumptions of statistical analysis rarely hold.  So the challenge for the pragmatist is to understand when evidence is strong enough to support action.  That’s where sensitivity analysis comes in – so we can understand how robust our inferences are to challenges to our assumptions. One example is statements such as “XX% of the estimated effect would have to be due to bias to change your inference about the effect.”  But that’s just one.  Below we’ll discuss lots of approaches, applications, and the pluses and minuses. Let’s get started with [COVID examples](https://www.konfound-it.org/2020/05/12/covid-introduction/).
