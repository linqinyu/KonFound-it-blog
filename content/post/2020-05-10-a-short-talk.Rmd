I summarized our current thinking on how robustness analysis can be applied to emerging COVID research in a brief presentation at an online conference entitled “COVID-19 and Public Policy and Management.” The conference was hosted by the Center on Technology, Data, and Society at Arizona State University, and a recording of the 15-minute talk, entitled “Communicating the Robustness of Inferences as COVID-19 Evidence Accumulates”, is available [here](https://youtu.be/3Djd0EmvL8Q).
