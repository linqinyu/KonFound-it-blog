<p>Now consider the previous example of Remdesivir but instead we are interested in the continuous outcome variable of time to clinical improvement.</p>

<p>We can interpret the robustness of inference regarding Remdesivirâ€™s effect on time to clinical improvement in following ways.</p>

## To invalidate an inference, 70.544% of the estimate would have to be due to bias. This is based on a threshold of 0.362 for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05).
## To invalidate an inference, 186 observations would have to be replaced with cases for which the effect is 0.

## Impact Threshold for a Confounding Variable:
## The minimum impact to invalidate an inference for a null hypothesis of 0 effect is based on a correlation of 0.546 with the outcome and at 0.546 with the predictor of interest (conditioning on observed covariates) based on a threshold of 0.121 for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05).
## Correspondingly the impact of an omitted variable (as defined in Frank 2000) must be 0.546 X 0.546 = 0.298 to invalidate an inference for a null hypothesis of 0 effect.
