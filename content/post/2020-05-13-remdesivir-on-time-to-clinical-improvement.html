<p>Now consider the previous example of Remdesivir but instead we are interested in the continuous outcome variable of time to clinical improvement.</p>

<p>We can interpret the robustness of inference regarding Remdesivirâ€™s effect on time to clinical improvement in following ways.</p>

## To sustain an inference, 28.2% of the estimate would have to be due to bias. This is based on a threshold of 1.713 for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05).
## To sustain an inference, 74 of the cases with 0 effect would have to be replaced with cases at the threshold of inference.

## Impact Threshold for a Confounding Variable:
## The maximum impact to sustain an inference for a null hypothesis of 0 effect is based on a correlation of 0.174 with the outcome and at 0.174 with the predictor of interest (conditioning on observed covariates) based on a threshold of 1.713 for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05).
## Correspondingly the impact of an omitted variable (as defined in Frank 2000) must be 0.174 X 0.174 = 0.03 to sustain an inference for a null hypothesis of 0 effect.
