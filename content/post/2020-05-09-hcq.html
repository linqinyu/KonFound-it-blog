<p>Since we have a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times2\)</span> table, we use tkonfound function to calculates the number of cases (RIS) that would have to be switched from one cell to another of a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times2\)</span> table to invalidate an inference made about the association between the rows and columns. This can be applied to treatment vs control with successful vs unsuccessful outcomes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>konfound::tkonfound(a = 14, b = 17, c = 6, d= 25)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;The tkonfound function calculates the number of cases that would have to be switched from one cell to another of a 2x2 table to invalidate an inference made about the association between the rows and columns. This can be applied to treatment vs control with successful vs unsuccessful outcomes.&quot;

## [[2]]
## [1] &quot;See konfound_fig for full and accessible details in graphic form!&quot;
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] &quot;To invalidate the inference, 1 case needs to be transferred from treatment success to treatment failure, as shown, from the User-entered Table to the Transfer Table.&quot;
## 
## $User_enter_value
##           Fail Success
## Control     14      17
## Treatment    6      25
## 
## $Transfer_Table
##           Fail Success
## Control     14      17
## Treatment    7      24
## 
## [[6]]
## [1] &quot;For the User-entered Table, we have a Pearson&#39;s chi square of 4.724, with p value of 0.030.&quot;
## 
## [[7]]
## [1] &quot;For the Transfer Table, we have a Pearson&#39;s chi square of 3.528, with p value of 0.060.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now we tkonfound_fig to generate the figure that plots the change in effect size as a function of switching outcomes for treatment cases.</p>
