Since we have a $2 \times2$ table, we use tkonfound function to calculates the number of cases (RIS) that would have to be switched from one cell to another of a $2 \times2$ table to invalidate an inference made about the association between the rows and columns. This can be applied to treatment vs control with successful vs unsuccessful outcomes.
```{r}
konfound::tkonfound(a = 14, b = 17, c = 6, d= 25)
```

Now we tkonfound_fig to generate the figure that plots the change in effect size as a function of switching outcomes for treatment cases. 
```{r,warning = FALSE}
konfound::tkonfound_fig(a = 14, b = 17, c = 6, d= 25)
```
