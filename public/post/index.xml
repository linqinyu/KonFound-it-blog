      <description>Since we have a \(2 \times2\) table, we use tkonfound function to calculates the number of cases (RIS) that would have to be switched from one cell to another of a \(2 \times2\) table to invalidate an inference made about the association between the rows and columns. This can be applied to treatment vs control with successful vs unsuccessful outcomes.
konfound::tkonfound(a = 14, b = 17, c = 6, d= 25) ## [[1]] ## [1] &amp;quot;The tkonfound function calculates the number of cases that would have to be switched from one cell to another of a 2x2 table to invalidate an inference made about the association between the rows and columns.</description>
