# Reproduce examples with Konfound

First install the development version of konfound and library the package with: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrosen48/konfound")
library(konfound)
```

## konfound: HCQ on Pneumonia

Since we have a $2 \times2$ table, we use tkonfound function to calculates the number of cases (RIS) that would have to be switched from one cell to another of a $2 \times2$ table to invalidate an inference made about the association between the rows and columns. This can be applied to treatment vs control with successful vs unsuccessful outcomes.
```{r}
konfound::tkonfound(a = 14, b = 17, c = 6, d= 25)
```

Now we tkonfound_fig to generate the figure that plots the change in effect size as a function of switching outcomes for treatment cases. 
```{r,warning = FALSE}
konfound::tkonfound_fig(a = 14, b = 17, c = 6, d= 25)
```

## konfound: Remdesivir on mortality

```{r}
konfound::tkonfound(a = 10, b = 68, c = 22, d= 136)
```
```{r, warning=F}
konfound::tkonfound_fig(a = 10, b = 68, c = 22, d= 136)
```

## konfound: Remdesivir on time to clinical improvement

Since the outcome is a continuous variable, we use pkonfound.
```{r}
konfound::pkonfound(est_eff = 1.23, 
          std_err = .87, 
          n_obs = 263, 
          n_covariates = 0)
```
